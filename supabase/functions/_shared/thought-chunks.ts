/**
 * Writes per-chunk embeddings for a thought that is already saved.
 *
 * The parent thought keeps its own whole-content embedding. Chunks are additive: search takes
 * the better of the document-level match and the best chunk-level match. So if chunking fails,
 * retrieval degrades to exactly the pre-chunking behaviour rather than breaking — which is why
 * callers use saveThoughtChunksSafe.
 *
 * Embeds one chunk at a time through generateEmbedding rather than a batch call. A student's
 * capture is at most a few dozen chunks, so the extra round trips cost seconds, not minutes —
 * and one call per chunk is far easier to read than a batching layer this kit does not need.
